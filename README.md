## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Have a quick overview of the equity market and the most actives stocks of the day
- From the ticker symbol on the main screen, user can click to view a more detailed summary of the individual stock, current price, day change, percentage change as well as daily line chart
- Enter ticker and search for specific stock

## My process

### Built with

Front-end:

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/)

  Backend:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Express](https://expressjs.com/)
- [Cheerio](https://cheerio.js.org/)

### What I learned

- SCSS: I really enjoy using SCSS over regular CSS as you can nest CSS selectors that follow the same hierarchy of your code.
- Cheerio & JQuery: Trying to ultilize Cheerio to scrape financial data from Yahoo!Finance, I gotta familize myself with JQuery as Cheerio implements a subset of core jQuery.

### Continued development

- Add Financials tab showing Income Statement, Balance Sheet and Cash Flow
- Add Profile tab to show contact info, Key Executives, Description, Upcoming events of each company
- Add Analysis tab to show Earnings Estimate, Revenue Estimate etc.
